### Welcome to my repository
_For knowledge, press **Back**. For bugs, keep browsing..._

> #### Disclaimer:
> In this repository, there are declared different rules of _time_. Weeks in this repository start by **Saturday**!
> This has been done so it's easier to follow the Syllabus structure.
> 
> ##### Note:
> Between weeks 5 and 6 was the holiday break. Everything, that has been done during this period is stored in week-05.
> _(only one program has been finished during this period, but it's always nice to have everything tracked...)_
> 
> Additionally, the time got sligthly out of sync after the skiing holiday (week-09) so... Happy searching for stuff!
