        <h3>Corporate lazy guy</h3>

        <p>
          A few years ago, I got a job at the corporate company. There I'm the whole day at the computer, doing an
          extremely repetitive job (better said copy-pasting). Because I'm lazy, I'm trying to teach the computer to do my
          work instead of me. This was actually taking me further and further to programming, even that I didn't know it
          yet...
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I'd like to study programming again, even when I didn't understand it for the first time at school. Thanks
          to my current job, I have realized that I would like to keep working with computers in the future, and the
          programming seems to be a good way to increase my chances to do so.
        </p>
